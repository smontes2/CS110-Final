# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
In this program, the user enters a stock ticker symbol. The program then generates certain information about
that company and displays it in the terminal.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
There are no known bugs, however after the ticker symbol is entered, it takes a couple of seconds for
the data to print onto the screen.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
I had to watch a youtube video to see exactly how the twelvedata stock database worked, but then from 
there I was able to figure out the rest.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
I feel like this is too simple, I hope that it is now, as mentioned I was planning on making
a full blown website but that was a little to much for this time frame.
